                        <p>
                            In the 2020 Spring Semester I began working with San Diego State University's IT User Services Department, as a part of the ServiceNow Deployment Team. I worked with an Agile team as both an Application Administrator and Platform Developer. My core responsibilities
                            on the team was to support IT division staff with the utilization and development of the ServiceNow platform for campus use.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once I had demonstrated a solid understanding of the ServiceNow platform, I became one of the main contributors to the SDSU Service Catalog project. Our mission was to migrate the IT User Services catalog, which was previously listed on Azure or hosted
                            independently by their respective departments, to a centralized university service portal. Additionally, I became responsible for the design and development of an IT Service Management mobile application built using ServiceNow's
                            application development toolkit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After 6 months of working with IT User Services and reaching the end of my final semester at SDSU, my employment with San Diego State University ended as the student developer position is only available to active students.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In August of 2020, I became a certified Systems Administrator after passing the ServiceNow Systems Administrator Certification exam.

                            <li><a>As an Application Administrator:</a>
                                <p> I addressed IT user issues and concerns regarding the platform. Through the use of ServiceNow's Incident Management system, I supported IT process users by maintaining timely communication with the involved members, developing
                                    and testing platform solutions in the development instance, and then implementing finalized solutions into the production instance. Often times my tasks involved troubleshooting issues submitted by users, implementing
                                    new functions and features of the platform, and updating forms and user interfaces on the web portal.
                                </p>

                                <p> I was my responsibile for being familiar with core ServiceNow platform functions and basics as well as have an understanding of the web-client's structure and scripts. The development of features and functions, including
                                    the service catalog and web portal, required knowledge of the platform's data table interactions, XML document formatting, and ServiceNow's client-side JavaScript Glide API.

                                        <p>In March of 2020, I began working with the development team to build a new service catalog for SDSU. Our task was to migrate the university's service catalog from the previous Azure implementation, to a new centralized
                                            web portal using ServiceNow. On the team I was responsibile for building, testing and implementing catalog items. This process required gathering requirements from department leadership, building workflows and
                                            task tables, constructing variable sets and catalog items, and building automated-test suites to ensure catalog integrity with every item implementation.
                                        </p>

                                        <p class="project-title">SDSU ITSM Mobile Agent iOS/Android App</p>
                                        <p>In April of 2020, after going through the initial stages of the Service Catalog implementation, I was asked to look into building a proof-of-concept ITSM Incident Management mobile application. I studied the ServiceNow
                                            Studio application builder, mobile development best-practices and UX design. The application was designed to be intuitive and provide IT process users with a clear and quick way of creating, updating and resolving
                                            incidents. Based on my experiences working in the Instructional Technology Services, I wanted to build the kind of mobile application I wish I had while I worked in the field troubleshooting issues, writing
                                            updates and communicating with ITS staff.

                        <h3 class="secondary">Oct 2019 - Jun 2020</h3>
                        <p>During the Fall 2019, I began working with the San Diego State University Instructional Technology Services(ITS) Department. Dedicated to providing support to faculty and staff, ITS also maintains the equipment in select classrooms
                            on campus. Many of my responsibilites working with ITS involved on-site classroom support, remote over-the-phone assistance. My core responsibilities with ITS were to assist faculty and staff with troubleshooting issues campus
                            wide, collaborate with other student assistants in developing software solutions that enhance classroom experiences, and support ITS staff with impromptu tasks and responsibilites.
                        </p>
                        <p>In the Spring of 2020, I was approched with the opportunity to work with the IT User Services Department in developing and deploying ServiceNow as an IT Support tool campus-wide. I accepted the offer on the premise that I would
                            be able to commit some time every week to completing the projects I had already started at ITS.
                        </p>
                        <p>From Februrary until June of 2020, I devoted four of my allowed twenty hours per week into coordinating with my ITS team members on finishing project I had already been leading. In July of 2020, after completing my final course
                            required for graduation, I was approved for full-time work for the duration of the semester. However, it was requested that my time be dediceted solely to ServiceNow development work. I produced a project guide to help in the
                            transition and handed responsibility for this project to my ITS team members.

                                    <p>I Worked to troubleshoot hardware and software issues remotely and on location for faculty and staff. My responsibilities in this role required that I have a working knowledge of classroom equipment and software, knowledge
                                        of both Windows and macOS and be able to provide immediate classroom support on a daily basis.

                                    <p>Other responsibilites included daily tasks in classroom maintenence and regular software updates for classroom computers and our own inventory of loaner laptops. ITS also maintained an inventory of equipment available
                                        for checkout by all staff and faculty, this equipment is maintained by the student assistants who also handle the check-out/check-in.</p>

                                    <p> I worked to design, implement and test software solutions that enhance user experiences for SDSU's many staff, faculty and students. Working closely with fellow ITS team members, I lead and participated in various projects
                                        for the Instructional Technology Services Department. My background as a Computer Science major and experiences working in teams with others, put me at the lead of a project aimed at producing subtitles out of recorded
                                        lecture audio using Amazon Web Services. I was involved in other projects in ITS including one to develop a conversion tool to produce compatible CSVs for the ParScore grading tool.
                                    </p>

                                            <p>With the adoption of the Canvas Learning Managment System, faculty relying on ITS support faced the challenge that the new Canvas system did not have a compatible tool to convert their grading spreadsheets into
                                                CSV files for the Scantron ParScore grading program to use. The previous implementation of this program was developed for Blackboard, which the university was in the stages of discontinuing. This issue required
                                                a new program to be written that could be implemented on Canvas and provide the SDSU faculty with the same service as the last. Built in Python and utilzing the Pandas Data relational data library, we worked
                                                on a web-service that would allow faculty to upload their grading spreadsheets for conversion and recieve a compatible CSV file to be used with ParScore.</p>

                                            <p>In the Fall and Winter of 2019, we were asked to look into using Amazon Web Services to build a tool for converting lecture audio into subtitles for use in BlackBoard and Canvas. Our lecture video and audio
                                                were recorded using the MediaSite lecture capture software. By leveraging the MediaSite REST API we would retrieve the audio files necessary and then upload them to our AWS storage. Then, using the AWS Boto3
                                                Python API, a series of scripts would send job requests to the AWS client and upload files into the AWS Machine Learning Audio Transcription suite. This suite returns a JSON file of the detected speech-to-text
                                                content with time stamps and confidence values. This file would then be converted to the standard .srt subtitle format and be used alongside lecture video.</p>

                            My earliest working experiences came from years of working retail at my local Best Buy. What began as my first "real-world" job, became a character shaping experience. Throughout those years I developed a strong work ethic, a standard for consistency,
                            and reputation for leadership, reliability and respect in the workplace. <br> Despite the lack of correlation between retail inventory and software development, the soft-skills and experiences gained
                            through this position strengthened my skills both as an individual and as a team member. I valued my work greatly, I always performed at my best, and I always clocked into a shift with a positive attitude and a motivation to
                            take on the daily challenges.

                            As I developed my academic plan and looked towards my transfer to a 4-year university I moved myself towards a position within my store with more flexible hours so I could complete my studies. In the Fall of 2019, I left my position at Best Buy to complete
                            my final year at San Diego State University and take advantage of an opportunity to work IT on campus.

                                    <p>
                                        My role as an inventory specialist spanned a variety of responbsibilies and duties. My core responsibilities was to maintain inventory integrity by keeping active stock up to date, fullfilling orders, and leading restocking procedures on a weekly basis.
                                        Being one of the senior members of our team I had come to learn every aspect of the warehouse, everything from daily standard merchandising procedures, to invetory manegement tasks. My experiences in inventory strengthened
                                        my communication, task prioritization, and team coordination. As a leader in my team, I was responsible for bringing new-hires up to date with standard operating procedures, completing business critical paperwork
                                        on a daily basis, and coordinating teams of 4-5 on weekly inventory restocking procedures.
